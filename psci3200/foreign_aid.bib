	abstract = {Decades of research regarding the effect of foreign aid on economic growth in less developed countries have produced inconclusive results. Research in this literature has been plagued by a variety of empirical impediments. Among them, measurement and endogeneity issues, sparse sets of control variables that may be correlated with both foreign aid and economic growth such as institutional quality, and disagreements regarding the appropriate econometric methodology. This paper highlights a further issue: the heterogeneous effects of foreign aid on growth across less developed countries. Previous studies have pooled all of the developing countries together, treating them as homogenous, despite that developing countries are vastly different across both observable and unobservable dimensions. Developing countries differ in their stages of development, per capita income, socio-economic, financial, and political characteristics. For this reason, the World Bank (2012) broadly classifies the developing countries into two categories: low income developing countries (LIDCs) and high income developing countries (HIDCs) based on per capita income. Our hypothesis is that the relationship between foreign aid and economic growth should be different among LIDCs and HIDCs. For this reason, we analyze the relationship between foreign aid and economic growth separately for LIDCs and HIDCs, producing estimates using samples which are more likely to be homogenous.. Integrating the fullest set of control variables thus far in the literature such as unemployment rate, capital formation, government budget surplus, inflation rate, degree of trade openness, and corruption, and using GMM methodology in a dynamic setting we find that foreign aid has positive effects on growth in high-income developing countries and negative effects on growth in low-income developing countries. We also find that higher unemployment rates, higher inflation, and higher levels of corruption reduce economic growth in both LIDCs and HIDCs. Additionally, higher level of capital formation, a larger budget surplus, and higher degrees of trade openness contribute positively to economic growth in both LIDCs and HIDCs. We do not find any evidence that time trends in the data affect our results. The result remains after accounting for endogeneity concerns and when a measure of institutional quality proxied by corruption. The finding implies that foreign aid has beneficial effects in high-income developing countries which are at latter stages of development. This suggests that countries need to gain some “traction” before foreign aid can help.},

	abstract = {Foreign aid is one of the most important policy tools that developed countries use to help poor countries improve population well-being and facilitate economic and institutional development. However, the effectiveness of aid as an instrument of development has been questioned several times, especially for its deleterious effects on governance. This study examines the effect of foreign aid on economic complexity in 78 developing countries over the period 1990–2017. We combine different identiﬁcation strategies and the following results are established. First, we ﬁnd evidence that foreign aid reduces economic complexity. Second, we show that the effect of foreign aid on economic complexity is heterogeneous to the level of economic complexity and to the nature of aid received. More speciﬁcally, we show that while foreign aid reduces economic complexity in countries with lower levels of economic complexity, the effect is positive in countries with higher levels of economic complexity. Additionally, we show that while foreign aid in the energy and education sectors increases economic complexity, the effect is negative for agricultural and humanitarian aid. Three, we further ﬁnd a U-shaped relationship between foreign aid and economic complexity. Finally, the empirical results of this paper show that democracy mitigates the negative effect of foreign aid on economic complexity. Thus, in order to beneﬁt from the effects of foreign aid for better economic complexity, the governments of developing countries would beneﬁt from putting more effort into improving democracy.},
